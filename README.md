<br><I>Notes</I>
<br>Hardcoded the distances in pixel between the bookmark icons and buy button
<br>Will change it sometiem
<br>pyautogui kinda of requires the PNG to be pixel perfect, you may play around with confidence if it doesnt dectect 
<br>Kinda of sad that i must be on maximum 1080p screen, I will finisih up the code for findEmulatorSize and other stuff at a later stage
<br>Leave Test.py ... not even remotely close to done with that one ...
